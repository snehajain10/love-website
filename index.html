Please don't get mad or irritated or annoyed with me and mujhpe chilaya mat karo. I know you are trying, it's just start communicating more. Just know,you should say sorry instantly when you do something wrong, it'll be enough for me. Thank you so much for being patient with me, thank you for handling everything so calmly. Sorry I fight kabhi kabhi but I love you soooo much and I miss you so much.
