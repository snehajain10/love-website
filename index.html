      <p>You are the most precious part of my life. I feel so happy with you. I love spending time with you and talking to you. Please don't get mad or irritated or annoyed with me and mujhpe chilaya mat karo. I know you are trying kaafi zyada, start sharing more. Start accepting instantly when you are wrong and don't avoid any fight for more than 3-4 hours and NEVER give me space or time to think. Thank you so much for being patient with me, thank you for handling everything so calmly. Sorry I fight kabhi kabhi but I love you soooo much and I miss you so much.
